# The HomePage of Google!!

This is a little exercise from [Project Odin] (http://www.theodinproject.com/).
The entire page was hard coded just by looking at Google's homepage and eventually digging in with Chrome's Inspector.
It's worth noting that this is just the HTML and CSS files, there is no actual functionallity in the page.
